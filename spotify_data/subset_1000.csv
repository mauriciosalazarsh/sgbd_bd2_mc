I want to get high and Fly Away Lookin' back on my life I've come so far from the man that I was... a broken, homeless, hopeless, empty shell, looking for love. I came up out of the gutter with a dream of having some kids, knowing that the life I'd give couldn't be no better than the life that I've lived. But I've got one chance to break this cycle, make right all my wrongs... I swear to Jesus Christ it hurts me just to write out this song. Though everybody's got their demons from the choices we make, we can either burn, learn, run, hide or correct our mistakes. Not caring about life just seemed so simple, shootin' at little kids, until I think about my daughters takin' a bullet for something I did. Then everything that made so much sense is long and forgotten. I hate myself and I can't even remember the reason I shot them, so God tell me... what's love if hate can break it? What's life if death can take it? I don't really believe in life or love... so roll the bud I love herb, I don't want to fight it so I take that weed and I light it. Ain't nothing in this world to make me want to stay. I want to get high and Fly Away I wonder what it takes to be free, crying, confined in my misery. Ain't no pictures of perfected been painted within my history. I'm used to being the subject of peoples aggression, left alone turning to violence and drugs for affection. It's like I'm walking this line between my love and my lust. The streets been calling me for years sayin' ""why'd you forget us?"" I wanna go back so bad, invitation to my casket. It seems I'm torn between the man I am and a man of the past... you selfish bastard. Actin' like my kids ain't enough. They hug me sayin' ""Daddy play with us before we grow up!"" So I throw away this gangsta mask before I watch my daughters grow into women on the other side of a prison glass. All that I ask in this life I've been giving is to give back the life I never had to my wife and my children. I pack a blunt then say a prayer, find shelter from stress... and like Psalm 55 I'm gonna Fly Away and be at rest I love herb, I don't want to fight it so I take that weed and I light it. Ain't nothing in this world to make me want to stay. I want to get high and Fly Away Love is in the air tonight, but I wouldn't know. When I'm lonely, feeling like the world don't know me... there's nothing here for me. Love is just a lie tonight and that's all I know because I'm lonely, feeling like the world won't hold me... there's nobody here for me I love herb, I don't want to fight it so I take that weed and I light it.
